# ri7engine

*A common interface to different underlying game-related libs.*

This is a project that I started long ago with the intent to create a common
interface to various underlying libs I was using for game development.

Three modules where started:

 - ri7database: A wrapper around sqlite
 - ri7graphics: A wrapper around irrlicht
 - ri7net: A wrapper around ENet
